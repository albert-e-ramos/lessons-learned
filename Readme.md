Oh, What Learning!
===

or, How I learned to Google All the Things

So far, I've covered the following at Bloc:
1. Git
2. GitHub
3. Markdown for Slack
4. Markdown for GitHub
5. HTML5
6. CSS3

*Up next, JavaScript!*

Hold that thought.

Actually, there is more Git and GitHub to learn before tackling the JS material.

I will finish up the Git and GitHub material on CodeSchool along with the Bloc quiz by Friday morning.

I will start the JS material on Sunday.
